## **3. 🧑‍💻 Development Process**

### **3.1 📝 Planning and Design**

The development process began with understanding the restaurant's requirements 🍔 and designing wireframes for the application's layout 🎨. Tools like Figma were used to create mockups, ensuring a user-centric design approach.

### **3.2 🖥️ Frontend Development**

React components were developed to handle various parts of the application, such as the menu display 🍕, cart functionality 🛒, and order summary 📜. Next.js was utilized to implement SSR, ensuring that each page is pre-rendered on the server 🖥️, improving load times ⏱️ and SEO 📈.

### **3.3 🎨 Styling**

Tailwind CSS was employed to style the application. Its utility-first approach allowed for rapid styling ⚡ and customization, leading to a responsive 📱 and visually appealing design.

### **3.4 🖧 Backend Integration**

Node.js was used to set up a simple backend server to handle requests and manage data 🗃️. This setup laid the groundwork for future features like payment processing 💳 and user authentication 🔐.

## **5. 🛠️ Debugging Tools and Code Editor**

### **5.1 🔍 Debugging Tools**

To identify and resolve issues during development, the following debugging tools were utilized:

- **🔧 Browser Developer Tools**: Used for inspecting elements, monitoring network requests 🌐, and debugging JavaScript.
- **⚛️ React Developer Tools**: A browser extension that provides an interface for inspecting the React component tree, observing state and props, and profiling component renders.
- **⚙️ Next.js Debugging**: Leveraged Next.js's built-in error overlay and console warnings to identify issues during development.

### **5.2 🖥️ Code Editor**

The primary code editor used for development was **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. VS Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor that is highly customizable 🛠️ and provides excellent support for React development. It offers features like IntelliSense, debugging support, and a vast extension marketplace, making it an ideal choice for JavaScript and React development.
